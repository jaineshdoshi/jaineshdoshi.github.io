If you are famaliar with the Everest climb you know that the next stop after base camp, crossing the Khumbu icefall and across the Silent Valley is Camp 1. Correspondingly this is too a the first major outpost for this project. The main objective was to get an elementary version of a program alongwith the kernel depedencies run on the simulation created by the [base-platform][base-platform]. 

This post will be updated soon!!
