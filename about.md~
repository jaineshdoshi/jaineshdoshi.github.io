Hello there, I'm Jainesh Doshi, currently a fourth year undergraduate student at Indian Institute of Technology Bombay. I am pursuing Bachelors in electrical Engineering, Masters in Microelectronics and a minor in Systems and Control Engineering.

My key areas of interest are High Preformance Computing and Reconfigurable Architectures. 

I am currently working on a Google Summer of Project with ArchC (Computer Systems Lab, University of Campinas).
I am also working on Reconfigurable GPUs under [Prof. Virendra Singh](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~viren/) to enhance their performance further by adding more flexibility to the existing hardware.
